# Nebula Inject Contributing Guide

When contributing to Nebula Inject, we require that you follow these guidelines for:

1. [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)
2. [Features](#features)
3. [Testing](#testing)
4. [Style](#style)

## Bug Reports

If you have found a bug, please submit an issue or pull request with the fix.

## Features

For big features, it is recommended to open an issue before starting work on it. This allows for 
discussion and feedback before you start working on it.

### Testing

Please ensure that all tests pass before opening a pull request. If you have added new
functionality, it is preferred that you add tests for it. If you have fixed a bug for a component
that is already tested, please add a test that would have caught the bug.

## Style

Please run the IntelliJ formatter before making contributions. The configuration file can be found
in the `.editorconfig` file.
